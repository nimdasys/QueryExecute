QueryExecute
============

I liked this udf, http://www.cflib.org/udf/queryExecute, that Henry Ho (https://github.com/henrylearn2rock) uploaded to cflib. I prefer working in cfscript, so I decided to scriptify it and created a repo for it. I changed very little, added some var scoping for arguments.

As I've not created anything more than a gist on github, and forked stuff I like, I figured this was also a good way to work through what is takes to get a repo setup. Plus, can never hurt to have more git practice.
