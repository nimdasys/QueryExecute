QueryExecute
============

cfscript version of http://www.cflib.org/udf/queryExecute

I liked this udf that Henry Ho (https://github.com/henrylearn2rock) uploaded to cflib http://www.cflib.org/udf/queryExecute. I prefer working in cfscript, so I decided to scriptify his udf and create a repo for it.

As I've not created anything more than a gist on github, and forked stuff I like, I figured this was a good way to work through what is takes to get a repo setup.
